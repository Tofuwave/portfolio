<h2>Introduction</h2>

This portfolio website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences. It provides visitors with an overview of who I am, my expertise, and examples of my work.
Features

* Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
* Custom Styling: All styling is done using custom CSS, providing a unique and personalized visual appearance.
* Interactive Elements: JavaScript is used to implement interactive features such as smooth scrolling, dynamic content loading, and form submission handling.

<h2>Dev's thoughts</h2>
I just want to create with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS to test my skills, learn more about flexbox, CSS animations, and screen handling.
